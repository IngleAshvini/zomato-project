        "This project focuses on analyzing and predicting restaurant ratings using the Zomato restaurant dataset. Zomato is one of the largest food aggregation and restaurant discovery platforms, and restaurant ratings play a crucial role in influencing customer decisions and restaurant visibility. The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identify important factors affecting restaurant ratings, and build machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains multiple attributes such as restaurant name, location, online ordering availability, table booking facility, approximate cost for two people, votes, and ratings. The first phase of the project involves understanding the dataset structure, handling missing values, and performing data cleaning to ensure the dataset is analysis-ready. Duplicate and null values were handled using appropriate techniques to maintain data quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations following the UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) approach. Various charts such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, violin plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots were created to understand rating distributions and relationships between features. These visualizations revealed that restaurants with online ordering and table booking options generally receive higher ratings. Additionally, higher votes often correlate with higher ratings, indicating customer engagement plays an important role.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical hypothesis testing was performed to validate insights derived from EDA. Tests such as the independent t-test and Pearson correlation test were used to statistically confirm whether features like online ordering, table booking, and votes have a significant impact on ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering and preprocessing steps included label encoding for categorical variables, outlier handling, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and train-test splitting. Multiple regression models were implemented, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression with hyperparameter tuning, and Random Forest Regressor. Model performance was evaluated using R² score and Mean Squared Error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among all models, Random Forest Regressor performed the best due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions. The final trained model was saved using joblib for deployment readiness, and a sanity check prediction was performed on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides valuable business insights for restaurant owners and platforms like Zomato to improve service offerings, pricing strategies, and customer engagement. The model can further be extended for real-time rating prediction, recommendation systems, and deployment as a web application."
